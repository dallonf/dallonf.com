I am a thoughtful senior software engineer based in Austin, TX with 10 years of experience
in web application UI development. I am continuously learning and honing
my craft, driven to learn more and build better software. I consider
myself an expert with React and TypeScript, and highly versatile with
other stacks, including back-end development.
